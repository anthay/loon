        - The Loon reader assumes the given text is in valid UTF-8 encoding.
        - The reader does no general UTF-8 validation of the given source text.
        - If the UTF-8 BOM forms the first three bytes (0xEF 0xBB 0xBF) of the
          given Loon source text it is ignored.
        - If the UTF-8 BOM appears anywhere other than the first three bytes
          of the Loon source text it is parsed like any other UTF-8 character.
